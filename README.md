# RoboBoi
The directory "RoboBoi" is the folder with all the source code and other things that Intellij Idea created.

Bot needs JDA to work but this is included in the files

If you want to run the bot youself, just open this project in Intellij Idea and enter your bot's token in the code and run it. It will tell you to set it all up. Once your done setting all the values in the settings file you can restart the bot and it should be running.

# Releases
I don't add a release since it wouldn't work, because the bot token gets grabbed from my website with an auth key. So you need to compile the code yourself with your bot token.
