# RoboBoi
The directory "RoboBoi" is the folder with all the source code and other things that Intellij Idea created.

Bot needs JDA to work but this is included in the files

You can also just download the release and execute the java file like `java -jar RoboBoi.jar` and it will output to console what you need to do in order to run the bot
