# I'm currently rewriting my bot because this code is just bad
Snaekyy Discord Server: https://discord.gg/Kyj7NHa

DiscordBot is my discord bot for the discord server Snaekyy

The bot requires JDA version 4.1.0_84 to work. (Included in the folders)

The token of the bot is grabbed from my website so you wont be able to just steal my token.

You can try running the bot youself but you'll neet to get a token and a discord server where you can grab ID's for roles, channels and messages, because this bot is made for 1 discord server: Snaekyy

The bot is made in Intellij Idea so have fun trying to get everything set up.

My code is spaghetti :)

This is the direct path to all the .java files: https://github.com/floriankorstanje/DiscordBot/tree/master/DiscordBot/src/com/florn

Also the .jar file you can find will not work for you since I have an authentication thing where the bot will only get the token if it is run by me.
