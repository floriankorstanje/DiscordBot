The directory "RoboBoi" is the folder with all the source code and other things that Intellij Idea created.

Bot needs JDA to work but this is included in the files

If you want to run the bot youself, you're going to have to edit all the IDs for everything, you're also going to need a discord bot token but you'll have figure that out yourself. If you're coding in Intellij Idea just add the library. I don't know how eclipse works so you figure that out.

# Releases
I don't add a release since it wouldn't work, because the bot token gets grabbed from my website with an auth key. So you need to compile the code yourself with your bot token.
