# RoboBoi
The directory "RoboBoi" is the version of the bot I will be updating and working on. "DiscordBot" is an old version of the bot

Discord server: https://discord.gg/sKJS4Qa

Bot needs JDA to work but this is included in the files

If you want to run the bot youself, you're going to have to edit all the IDs for everything, you're also going to need a discord bot token but you'll have figure that out yourself. If you're coding in Intellij Idea just add the library. I don't know how eclipse works so you figure that out.
